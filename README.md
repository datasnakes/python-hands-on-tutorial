# python-hands-on-tutorial

A hands-on Python3 tutorial designed by the [Datasnakes](https://github.com/datasnakes).

## Background Information

The tutorial will introduce students to a variety of computational tools for solving common problems in biological research. Students will be taught the Python programming language through hands on exercises. Students will acquire knowledge and programming skills that will increase their productivity as researchers.

## Tutorial Objectives

 - Demonstrate improved typing skills.
 - Demonstrate an understanding of basic Python 3 by writing simple program scripts using language constructs, including - but not limited to variable creation and assignment, basic string-manipulation operations, 
 - Demonstrate the ability to debug programs written in Python 3 by identifying errors and fixing them.
 - Demonstrate the ability use markdown to create a README file for each project.

## Required Resources

 - IDE for python programming ([Anaconda's Spyder IDE]() or IDLE is suggested.)
 - Python 3.6
 - [Bioinformatics Data Skills](https://github.com/datasnakes/python-hands-on-tutorial/blob/master/resources/bioinformatics_data_skills.pdf)
 - [Python for Biologists](https://github.com/datasnakes/python-hands-on-tutorial/blob/master/resources/python_for_biologists.pdf)

### My First Project

1. Brainstorming - What do I want to accomplish?
2. Strategizing - What's the best way to reach my goal(s)?
3. Outlining - Create a framework with comments.
