# Teach Xiao how to type

Typing is important for coding effectively.  As a python programming half of your time will be spent simply conceptualizing or troubleshooting ideas.  The other half of your time, however, will be spent typing.  This includes writing code, but also using google and other forums in order to better research or understand your wants and needs.

So to start, we will begin learning python by simply learning to type efficiently.  Typing.com has an appealing interface (and it's free), so we can start there ([link](http://www.typing.com/student/join#5ABEBE34EBE0B)].  The link will take you to a classroom that I have set up.  This is pretty much a self learner exercise, but you can ask questions if you need to.  I would advise doing the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced all the way through twice :smile: lol.
