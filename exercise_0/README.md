# Exercise 0 - Learning to Type

## Objectives

- Improve typing in order to improve coding effciency

## Practice

- Start exercises at [typing.com](http://www.typing.com/student/join#5ABEBE34EBE0B)

Typing is important for coding effectively.  As (python) programmer, half of your time will be spent simply conceptualizing or troubleshooting ideas.  The other half of your time, however, will be spent typing.  This includes writing code, but also using google and other forums in order to better research or understand your wants and needs.

So to start, we will begin learning python by simply learning to type efficiently.  Typing.com has an appealing interface (and it's free).  The link above will take you to a classroom that has been set up.  This is a self learning exercise, but you can ask questions if you need to.  I would advise doing the `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, and `Advanced` all the way through twice :smile:.
